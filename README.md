# Color Bottles

This website generates random puzzles of the type "water sort color bottles". I did not find the real name but google shows the right results.

The goal is to sort each color into its own column. Click a column to highlight it. Then click another column to move the top color there. The target column has to be either empty or have the same color at the top and enough space.

I built this to play sometimes when there is no Internet. It uses no frameworks, just HTML, CSS and JS. It's running entirely in the browser, no interaction with a server. These puzzles also exist as mobile apps but they are full of ads and only work when constantly online.
