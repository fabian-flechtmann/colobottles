# Color Bottles

This small website shows a solver for puzzles of the type "water sort color bottles". I did not find the real name but google shows the right results.

When the website opens, a random level is generated and the solver runs immediately. If a solution is found, it can be inspected with the left and right buttons or arrow keys. The Enter key generates a new puzzle.

I built this because I enjoy watching the solution but don't like how the available apps are full of ads.
