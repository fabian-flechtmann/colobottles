* Start the game with 10 bottles, 2 empty, 8 colors, height 4, randomly shuffled
* "New game" button
	* Shows a modal window
	* Enter number of bottles, number of colors, height
		* Should be prefilled with the current level parameters
	* (optional) Enter custom level code
	* Press "Start game"
		* (optional) check newly generated level if it can actually be solved
* "Level code" is displayed and can be used to share a cool level
	* Level code should be easy to reverse engineer so smart kids can design their own levels
* "Hint" button
	* Solves the game in the background, shows a spinner
	* Blocks interaction while thinking
	* Shows how many moves are needed to win or that is game can't be won
	* Does the best move in the position
	* (Optional) cache the entire solution if "Hint" is pressed again, invalidate on user move
* "Undo" button
	* Goes back one move
	* Move might have been manual or hint
	* Can go back all the way to the beginning of the level
* Moves
	* Every bottle is a button
	* Once pressed, the bottle is highlighted
	* Every possible target bottle is highlighted in a different color
	* Clicking a different bottle highlights that bottle instead
	* Clicking a target bottle does the move and then removes all highlights
* Game over
	* When the level is solved, show a message but don't do anything else
	* When the player is out of moves, show a message but don't do anything else
